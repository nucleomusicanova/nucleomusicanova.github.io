Welcome to the _Project Website_ of the Research Group Núcleo Música Nova, a group dedicated to academic and artistic research of Contemporary Experimental Music. Created in 2012 at the State University of Paraná, the group is composed of researchers, undergraduate, and graduate students. We hold our meetings biweekly in person and online, for the discussion of numerous agenda items: individual research of each member, funded research projects, events organization, dissemination of new works, organization, and release of digital albums, among other things.

Among our activities, we highlight the biennial event SiMN - International Symposium of New Music, as well as independent projects by Ensemble Móbile, a group dedicated to the performance of new music.
